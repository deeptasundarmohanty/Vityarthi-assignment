Comprehensive Library of Number Theory & Computational Algorithms in Python
💡 Overview of the Project
This repository is an extensive collection of Python implementations for algorithms across Number Theory, Discrete Mathematics, and computational analysis. It provides foundational and advanced functions for tasks ranging from primality testing and factorization to sequence generation and various operations on special number types. Each script is self-contained and demonstrates its functionality, often including basic runtime and memory usage metrics.

Bash
pip install psutil
Installation & Setup
1.	Clone the repository or gather files: Place all the provided .py files into a single project directory.
2.	Navigate to the project directory:
Bash
cd [your-project-name]
Running a Script
To execute any of the algorithms, run the corresponding Python file from your terminal:
Bash
python "prime_power.py"
# Or
python "digital_root.py"
Many scripts contain an internal test case or prompt for user input. The script will execute and output the result, along with performance metrics where included.

✅ Instructions for Testing
Each script includes a built-in test case or uses a basic input() function for testing.
1.	Run the scripts: Execute the individual Python files.
2.	Verify the output: Check the printed Result against the known correct mathematical output for the test case provided. For example, running factorial.py with input 5 should output FACTORIAL: 120.
3.	Modify and Test: For thorough testing, change the input variables inside the scripts (e.g., change result = order_mod(2, 7) to result = order_mod(3, 10) in Order Mod.py) to test different values.
